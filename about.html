      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am <b> Jeru Carasi</b>, 21 years old student who is currently studying at <b> Rizal Technological University </b> under the course - <b> Bachelor of Science in Infomation Technology.</b> I live in <b> 15 C. CDJ Street of San Juan City.</b> Among the 4 siblings, I'm the youngest. Aside from sleeping, I'd also love to <b> cook, play basketball and online games, and travel.</b> As of now, I'm currently enhancing my skills on the field I'm interested to take, which is the <b> web development.</b> I don't know if this can be considered as unique ability, but i can identify or know how people thinks or feels about me. Sometimes, that ability allows me to act with caution to avoid possible conflicts and misunderstanding.
